## Welcome to AI Lab! ##
+ This is a playground for testing AI techniques.

It is kept simple and uses components for reading and preprocessing data, 
validation, running algorithms and finally showing results in a generated HTML file.

The idea is to research ideas and explain roughly what does what. 

This way someone else can just re-run it and see the flow of using it and learning on the way.
There are no rules how to use it except that it should be reproducible by anyone with a few commands. 

For the labs, some data is included and some will be downloaded when run. 


To install prerequisites (after setting up python 3.6 and pip) type:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

To Run type:

```
python AILab.py
```

And follow the menu choices
